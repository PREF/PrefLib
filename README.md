PrefLib
====

This project provides PREF core source code in a lightweight static library.

Everyone can write a graphical front-end for this library in order to provide 
a PREF version with its favorite GUI Toolkit and Operating System.

Library's Structure

The library provides C++ namespaces in order to have
the cleanest possible implementation:

- Format Parser Engine and Scripting (with [BTVM](https://github.com/PREF/BTVM))
- Binary Charts (Histogram, Entropy and Byte Class based)
- Binary Maps (DotPlot, BinaryMap, and Byte as Pixel)
- Platform Independent I/O classes

Dependencies and Requirements

- C++11 compiler
